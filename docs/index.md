# React Lua

React Lua is a Lua port of Facebook's [React JS](https://reactjs.org) UI library.

By and large, [React's documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) should be able to serve most React Lua users' needs. This documentation site serves as a comprehensive guide to the _differences_ between Roact and React.

If you're new to the React Lua library and want **to start learning the concepts of React**, begin with the [React JS documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

If you want **to find out if a React JS feature is present in React Lua (and if there are any differences to be aware of)**, check out the [API Reference](api-reference/react.md).

If you're familiar with React JS and want **to learn where React Lua differs**, start with the [Deviations page](deviations.md).

And if you want **to migrate an existing project from Legacy Roact to React Lua**, check out the guide on [Migrating From Legacy Roact](migrating-from-legacy/minimum-requirements.md).
